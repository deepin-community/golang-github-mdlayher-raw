Description: Read and write data at the raw network interface device level
 Raw is a golang package to access raw network sockets and read and write data
 directly to the wire.
 .
 For more information about using raw sockets with Ethernet frames in
 Go, the author has published
 https://mdlayher.com/blog/network-protocol-breakdown-ethernet-and-go/
 .
 The upstream project was deprecated with the release of v0.1.0, and the
 successor project github.com/mdlayher/packet should be used instead.
